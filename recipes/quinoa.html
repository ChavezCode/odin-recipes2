        <li>2 red delicious apples, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cup raspberries</li>
        <li>2 tbsp coconut sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra virgin coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ cup ground oats</li>
        <li>¾ cup quinoa flakes</li>
        <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>

    <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the apples, cornstarch, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of coconut sugar, and half of the cinnamon. Once thoroughly mixed, add in the raspberries and mix gently as to not lose the shape of the berry. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the quinoa flakes and oats in a Magic Bullet or other blender that can produce a fine grind. Pulse blend grains a few times.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt and the remaining coconut sugar and cinnamon to the grain mixture and blend again.</li>
        <li>Drizzle melted coconut oil into the dry mixture and pulse again to form a crumbly mixture.</li>
        <li>Transfer the apple and raspberry mixture to a baking dish and top with the crumble mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover the crumble with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Let crumble stand for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh raspberries.</li>
    </ol>
