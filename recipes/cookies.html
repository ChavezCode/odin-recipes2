    <p><h3><strong>Description</strong></h3></p>
    <p>Vegans and gluten-free eaters, rejoice! 'Tis the season to partake in holiday goodies.</p>

    
    <!--Ingredients-->
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp natural peanut butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup ground almonds</li>
        <li>⅛ cup pea protein powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp agave syrup</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ tsp allspice, ground</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend all ingredients until you achieve cookie-dough consistency. Taste to ensure you've achieved your desired level of sweetness. Adjust accordingly.</li>
        <li>Roll your cookie dough into a nonstick cookie tray, and cut out your Christmas shapes with a cookie cutter (think trees, snowmen, and Santas).</li>
        <li>Bake at 340 degrees F (170 C) for 10-12 minutes or until the cookies are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Now comes the most important step: Allow the cookies to cool completely. If you try to eat them before they've cooled, they'll crumble, and your effort will be for naught.</li>
        <li>If you want to decorate your cookies, add some melted dark chocolate, calorie-free chocolate syrup, cocoa powder, shredded coconut, or whatever toppings you fancy the most!</li>
        <li>Note(s): You can substitute cashew or almond butter. You can substitute vanilla or unflavored protein. You can substitute coconut milk. Ground ginger and allspice or pumpkin pie spice is optional.</li>
    </ol>
